The Canopy Resilience Project's tree death form to has been used to record the health of over 1000 tree canopies around Perth, but also for trees spanning Geraldton to the south coast.

We're very grateful to all the members of the community who have shown concern for Perth's trees and have contributed to the project. We're excited to share that this data is now being published on a map that updates daily.
